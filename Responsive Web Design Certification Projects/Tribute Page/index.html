				<h3>Professional Life</h3>
				<p>
					Downey’s ‘Chaplin’ (1992) is one of his biggest achievements until now. Richard Attenborough, the director of the movie, got him trained in many aspects that were necessary for a true portrayal of Chaplin, like, learning how to play violin, etc.
					<br>
					<br>
					Joining the cast of American television mini-series ‘Ally McBeal’, after serving his time in the prison, in 2000, was a great professional move from Downey’s side. He won many accolades for his role in the series.
					<br>
					<br>
					Downey’s characterization of ‘Tony Stark’ in ‘Iron Man (2008)’, ‘Iron Man 2 (2010)’ and ‘Iron Man 3 (2013), has made him into a huge blockbuster phenomena. His quirky and nonchalant personality in real life reflects in ‘Tony Stark’ which has made it so successful.</p>
